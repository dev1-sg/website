The dev container spec defines a standard for any development tool to use a container as a full-featured development environment.

The dev containers specification is maintained in the spec repo.

We maintain a set of [images](https://github.com/dev1-sg/devcontainers/tree/main/src/images/ubuntu-base) and [Features](https://github.com/dev1-sg/devcontainers/tree/main/src/features) as part of the specification.
